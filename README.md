### Web Developer, Student at Lambda School

## About Me

I'm Web Developer currently enrolled at Lambda School. Before diving into web dev, I honed and leveraged data skills in a variety of roles. I love to automate workflows for both myself and colleagues. I favor exploration over exploitation. I'm always looking for a better way to do things, but can work quickly and effectively when time is critical.
